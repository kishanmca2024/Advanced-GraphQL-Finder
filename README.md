## 🔧 **Installation**  

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kishanmca2024/Advanced-GraphQL-Finder.git
cd advanced-graphql-finder
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**  
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then run:  
```bash
pip install requests
```

---

## 🚀 **How to Use**  

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Input**  
Create a file (e.g., `domain.txt`) with a list of domains to scan. Use one domain per line:  
```plaintext
example.com
test.com
http://example.org
https://secure-site.net
```

### **Step 2: Run the Script**  
Run the script using Python:  
```bash
python interactive_graphql_finder.py
```

### **Step 3: Enter the File Name**  
When prompted, enter the name of your domain file:  
```plaintext
Enter the domain file name (e.g., domain.txt): domain.txt
```

### **Step 4: Review Results**  
The output will be saved in `graphql_advanced_results.txt`. Example output:  
```plaintext
✅ http://example.com/graphql - GraphQL Found!
❌ http://example.com/api/graphql - No response
✅ https://secure-site.net/v1/graphql - GraphQL Found!
```

## 🛠️ **Customization**  

### Add More Endpoints  
Edit the `GRAPHQL_ENDPOINTS` variable in the script to add additional paths:  
```python
GRAPHQL_ENDPOINTS = [
    "/graphql", "/graphiql", "/api/graphql", "/v1/graphql", "/custom/graphql"
]
```

### Add Authentication  
Add authentication headers by modifying the `headers` dictionary:  
```python
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "AdvancedGraphQLFinder/1.0",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
}
```

### Adjust Timeout or Threads  
- Change the `timeout` in the `requests.get` method to fit your network latency.  
- Modify the `max_workers` parameter in `ThreadPoolExecutor` for faster or more granular performance.

## 🛡️ **Troubleshooting**  

### **Common Issues and Fixes**  

| Issue                          | Possible Cause                                | Solution                                |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `FileNotFoundError`            | Incorrect or missing domain file.             | Ensure the file exists in the directory. |
| No endpoints detected          | Rare or non-standard GraphQL paths.           | Add custom paths to `GRAPHQL_ENDPOINTS`. |
| Slow scanning                  | Large domain list or network latency.         | Increase `max_workers` or reduce `timeout`. |
